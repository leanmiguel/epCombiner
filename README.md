# EpCombiner for subs2srs audio

In conjunction with the program that Matt and Yoga created for condensed audio immersion (youtube video link: https://youtu.be/QOLTeO-uCYU) this python script aims to seperate each episode from the sub2srs audio files and outputs each episode's individual condensed audio file. This is in contrast to 1 huge combined mp3 file that the program Matt and Yoga made (since all the audio files are not seperated)

## To Dos

Clean up code --> no reused code // probably use a for loop instead of for in loop
